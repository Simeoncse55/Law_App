    In 1946, Objective Resolution was moved by Jawaharlal Nehru, describing the constitutional structure. In 1947 (22nd January) it was adopted. It shaped the Constitution of India and its modified version is reflected in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution. The basic tenets that the objective resolution highlighted were:
Constituent Assembly’s resolve to see India as independent, sovereign and republic
To draw a Constitution for India
To make all territories of the pre-independent India into united states of post-independent India
To realize residual powers, autonomy on such states as the Constitution of India reflects
To realize union with the power which will be different than those given to such states
The people of India to play the source of power and authority of the sovereignty, and the independence
To provide justice, social, economic and political equality of status of opportunity and, freedom of thought,expression, belief, faith, worship, vocation, association and action, subject to law and publicmorality before the law
